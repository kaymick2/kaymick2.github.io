    <h2 style="text-align: center">Psychology Corner: Nature vs. Nurture & Epigenetics</h2>

    <div style="text-align: left; padding: 20px;">
      <h3>Nature vs. Nurture</h3>
      <p>
        The nature versus nurture debate is one of psychology's oldest discussions. It asks:
        <ul>
          <li>Are we products of our genes (nature)?</li>
          <li>Or are we shaped by our environment and experiences (nurture)?</li>
        </ul>
        Modern understanding suggests it's not an either/or situation - both factors play crucial roles in human development.
      </p>

      <h3>Epigenetics: Where Nature Meets Nurture</h3>
      <p>
        Epigenetics is a fascinating field that bridges the gap between nature and nurture. It shows how environmental factors
        can influence how our genes are expressed, without changing the DNA sequence itself. Think of it like this:
        <ul>
          <li>Your DNA is like a recipe book (nature)</li>
          <li>Epigenetic markers are like sticky notes that can hide or highlight certain recipes</li>
          <li>Your environment and experiences (nurture) determine which sticky notes are placed where</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h3>Real-World Example</h3>
      <p>
        A classic example is how identical twins, despite having the same DNA, can develop different traits and health conditions
        based on their different life experiences and environmental exposures. This demonstrates how epigenetic changes can
        affect gene expression without altering the underlying genetic code.
