      <i>THE SERVER</i>
    </h2>

  <body>
    <h4 style="text-align: center;">"THE SERVER" is an HP ProLiant DL380 Gen9 that was destined for the dumpster at a company.</h4>
    <div style="line-height: 2;">
       <ul>
    <li>I was in the right place at the right time and saved it from said dumpster.</li>
    <li>It is currently hosting about 4TB of backups, system images, and Linux ISOs. It has 10TB of storage, with a mass SSD upgrade in the works.</li>
    <li>The server is running in RAID5 with a dead storage cache battery.</li>
    <li>I have installed VMWare ESXi 7 on it and it is configured to be almost completely headless.</li>
    <li>I have used it to teach myself the basics of server grade hardware and software, including setting up Active Directory, a VPN, NAS, Virtual machines, and networking (Cisco switches on the way!).</li>
    <li>I have also played around with Ubuntu Server, and am currently teaching myself how to deploy a LAMP stack.</li>
</ul>

To top it all off, this server sits on a block of plywood in a college apartment, with 2 drives missing because I couldn't afford spares when I got it.<br>
It is the epitome of jankiness, and I guard it with my life.

I also have a Dell SAN from 2009.
